# LevelUp project

The purpose of this project is to create a todo system integrated with an activity progress tracker.

Users can create activities or goals to track and record their progress with them by completing items on their todo list.

The idea behind this project comes from role playing games where players often have skills that they level up by completing tasks or fulfilling challenges. As a player you can see the results of your efforts and get feedback and rewards for your progress which really helps to motivate you to continue playing.

I believe the same dynamics can be used in the real world to make a game of your regular activities, habits and things you need to do.

## Development

The project will be developed in stages with core functionality and features introduced first so a minimally viable product (MVP) can be produced. Additional features and changes will be included as the project progresses.

- June 30th. Brainstorming features, benefits and uses of the project. Whiteboard sketches and mockups were created to flesh out the ideas of the project. Different ideas about how the site can be used developed as I sketched out user interface ideas.

- July 1st. Took sketches and created higher fidelity first drafts in Figma. Just focused on the mobile designs first which meant figuring out core functionality.

- July 2nd. Planning to make this project MERN stack as that is my foundation. Initialized project, created repo, began the Readme file to document development. Brainstorming some decisions about the project including database schema, authentication options and different tech to use.

- July 3rd. Created base files and directory structure for the models and routes planned for this project. User, Todo and Activity
